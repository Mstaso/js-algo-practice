          <p> Chain stitch embroidery is an embroidery technique that interlocks the thread as it’s embroidered into a garment creating a unique and attractive thread line.  Because the entire process is done by hand, it allows the sewer to create nearly any design and often used to create highly detailed design sewn onto garments.   The technique and art form date back to the late 1800’s, and hit critical mass into the 1920’s.  At LS&B we utilize 1940’s 50’s and 60’s machines that still provide the classic look and feel.  </p>
